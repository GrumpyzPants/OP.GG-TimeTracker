# OP.GG-TimeTracker
This was one of the first codes I created using Selenium for Java. This was to test the knowledge I had gained after creating various other Selenium codes. The goal of this project is to compile a certain value found on a specified web page and add the total up. It can iterate over a specified number of times. The code will require the user to download the required selenium files and to used selenium-edge as the browser of choice. Once further refined, I will include links to the required files and a .jar file.
